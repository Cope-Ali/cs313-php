                <h2> Creative Problem Solving</h2>
                <p> The world doesn't need more rich people, or more famous people or even more smart people. What the
                    world really needs is more creative people. Knowing more than everyone else isn't worth much unless
                    you can use that knowledge to think of something no one else has. Innovation comes from creative
                    problem solving. Creative problem solving comes from play. Studying more facts doesn't teach you
                    how to see what isn't there, but could be. As the saying goes <span> " When two men think the same.
                        One is unnecessary " </span> Be brave! Think beyond the obvious! Learn to play, and play to
                    learn! </p>

                        Leadership and Self Deception <br> By Arbinger Institute
                        <ul>
                            <li> This book changed the way that I saw people. It probably saved my marriage. Plus it is
                                written as a story which makes it highly enjoyable to read. Essential for leaders,
                                parents, spouses, friends or anyone who interacts with people</li>

                        One Second After <br> By William R Forstchen
                        <ul>
                            <li>This novel tells the story of how a man survives an EMP attack on the United States.
                                This is not a new kind of warfare and we are not doing much to protect ourselves as a
                                country. This book really helped me have a better understanding for why we must learn
                                essential survival skills, keep emergency kits, and stop relying on everyone else to
                                protect us from catastrophy</li>
